I have always believed in the classical vision of the Renaissance man, in which the virtue was to find knowledge in all possible disciplines. 

Throughout my life, I have always been interested in all the aspects that surround us, and I can presume to enjoy not only the most relevant technological aspects, but also to find the existing beauty in any art. 


That is why my academic and professional profile over the years is quite eclectic, showing my natural curiosity for many different areas and something I assume with pride, as it allows me to always have a holistic vision of any current topic.

Without forgetting that not only the mind completes the man, I also like to invest my time to the sport, and I enjoy any opportunity to practice it.

I hope to continue discovering the world in all its disciplines and finding the balance between science, art and sport, and, in the process, inspire others to do the same.
